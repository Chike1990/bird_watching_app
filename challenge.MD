## Task Description
Instruction: Record your face and what you are typing. Wants to see how much time I spent coding and how comfortable I am with SQL.

Challenge: Build a bird watching app. Find out what bird watchers do/care about and make a simple bird watching app. The app should have some SQL that creates tables and insert some stuff; and that fetches stuff using join (to combine stuff from different table).

Make a 30 -40 mins video recording of your process and do the following:
    use 10 mins write some frontend for the application
    Use another 10 mins to write the first API
    Use another 10mins however I want

## My approach to solving the problem
1. Determine the data and the structure of the database (tables and relationships)
2. Write SQL to create the tables (Birds, species, observers, and observations)
3. Write SQL to insert stuff into the tables

4. Set up PSQL database to test the creation and insertions
5. Setup a nodejs server (check old projects); use docker; connect to the PSQL database
6. Write the first API for fetching all birds using 'join' to combine the observations and anoy other table

7. Test the server that it feetchs the results
8. Write frontend using react (use vite for tooling, axios for http request)
9. create a component that will list the reult of joining the tables birds, species and observations
10. practice and present using loom
